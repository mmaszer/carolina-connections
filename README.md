# carolina-connections

This is a web app for UNC students to built an academic support network by connecting with other students in similar situations. A new user can set 
up a profile and list their classes, clubs, and what they are looking for on the site. Once a profile is made, the user can filter for other students 
that are in the same classes and clubs, and even search for students who have purposes on the site matching their own. When a user finds another student 
they would like to connect with, they can hit the contact button on the student's profile and send them a message.
